# Step-by-Step Guide
## Summery
Run this on terminal for get all of requirements:

```sh
pip install opencv-python-headless tensorflow
```
Then copy or clone this code into your code editor. run it.</br>
<br>

## Used Libraries:
- **OpenCV**: For capturing and processing images.</br>
- **TensorFlow**: For loading and using the pre-trained model.

## Explation:
- We will use MobileNetV2 from TensorFlow's Keras applications, which is pre-trained on ImageNet.</br>
- Use OpenCV to capture images from your laptopâ€™s built-in camera.</br>
- Use the pre-trained MobileNetV2 model to classify the captured image.</br>
